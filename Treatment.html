     <font color="lightgreen" size="5">
	 <li>It is preferable that the student does not remove the muzzle from his face as soon as he leaves the house, to the school or university, until he returns from it, in order to avoid catching the Corona virus in crowded places, such as the classroom, the cafeteria and the bus.  Usually buses, rows and cafeterias are crowded with a large number of students, and it is better for the muzzle to remain on the face throughout the day and not to remove it if necessary.  It is worth mentioning that there is a specific and proper way to put the muzzle on the face and remove it: the muzzle should be held by the strips on both ends, with clean hands, and the most important thing is to make sure that it is valid and not pierced.  Then it is placed behind the ears to be firmly attached to the nose.</li><br>

  <font color="lightblue" size="5"><p>2- Clean and sterilize hands to prevent corona virus</p></font></font>
       <font color="lightgreen" size="5"><li>Hands should be cleaned well and regularly by washing them with soap and water and rubbing them well for no less than 20 seconds.  Students can also use a hand sanitizer that contains 60% disinfectant to kill germs and bacteria.  On the other hand, wearing gloves contributes to the prevention of Corona virus, especially on the school or university bus, and it is better for the gloves to be nylon so that the student throws them away after using them immediately.</li><br>

 <font color="lightblue" size="5"><p>3- Social distancing to prevent corona virus</p></font>
<font color="lightgreen" size="5"><li>Each student must maintain a safe distance of not less than 1 meter or 3 feet between him and another student, teacher or employee, especially in crowded places such as the cafeteria or sometimes the classroom.  If the student wants to enter her room to eat or drink, he must respect social distancing, a safe distance, and of course, wear a mask.  In this case, some schools and universities take preventive measures, including placing signs on the ground to indicate the appropriate place to stand.  Hence, maintaining a safe distance is essential in all cases, especially if the person exhibits symptoms of illness or symptoms of the Coronavirus such as coughing, sneezing, fever and colds.</li><br>

<font color="lightblue" size="5"><p>4- Not to touch the face to prevent corona virus</p></font></font>
       <font color="lightgreen" size="5"><li>If a student does not wash his hands after touching surfaces at school and university, such as a table, door, books, pens or computer, he can catch viruses.  The hands will get dirty and may transmit the virus that can enter the eyes, mouth or nose, so the pupil touches his face without cleaning the hands.</li><br>

 <font color="lightblue" size="5"><p>5- Avoid touching surfaces to prevent corona virus</p></font>
    <font color="lightgreen" size="5"><li>If you are a student at the university or are sending your child to school, you must know that avoiding touching surfaces as much as possible is very important to prevent corona virus.  It is known that this epidemic lives on surfaces: it lasts 72 hours on plastic and iron and 24 hours maximum on paper and copper.  Therefore, care must be taken when touching surfaces at school or at the university, and washing hands immediately afterwards, and that the student is not exposed to catching the virus:

<font color="lightgreen" size="5"><li>If the student feels symptoms of a disease similar to symptoms of the Coronavirus, it is best to stay at home so that he does not spread the virus if he had caught it.  Therefore, he must inform the school or university about his illness and what symptoms he feels.</li><br>
